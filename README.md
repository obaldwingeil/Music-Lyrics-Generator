# Music-Lyrics-Generator
This project uses the N-gram model to generate song lyrics based on genre

# Abstract
Music is widely popular today and remains a huge part in peopleâ€™s lives. The industry was record to have a network of $19 million with more than a million songs released each year. Therefore, we are interested in seeing if we could train a machine that could potentially create a hit song of its own. In this paper, we will be discussing our N-gram model that was used to generate six lines of lyrics based on one of the ten genres chosen by the user. The different lyric outputs reflects how specific words and phrases are more attuned to specific genres as we used the top 100 songs from Metro Lyrics.
